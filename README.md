Conceptualized and built a prototype for a service marketplace website, aimed at selling services as products. In this project, users can register as a regular user, company, or freelancer. After registering, the admin verifies their profile, and once approved, the user is listed as a valid service provider. Other users can then book services from these verified providers

    source venv/bin/activate


Step 2: Install Required Modules
--------------------------------
Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


Step 3: Run Migrations

Apply the database migrations by running the following commands:

    python manage.py makemigrations
